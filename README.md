NIST Framework
Introduction
NIST CSF contains a set of outcomes that can be utilized by organizations and governments irrespective of their background to achieve the security posture and manage the cybersecurity risks in an efficient manner. The addition of governance function which maintains the other key functions such as identify, detect, protect, respond and recover was the hot update in new release of NIST CST 2.0. The foundation of NIST Framework lies in the six functions and organizations can choose the desired outcomes to manage their cybersecurity programme.  NIST framework can play a significant role in assessing, analyzing the risks that are existing and communicate the identified risks between higher level executives. Organizations can utilize NIST Framework to prepare for preventing or minimize the impact of incidents as well as managing the incidents using respond, recover and govern functions. This Framework does not specify how the outcomes are achieved but provides more details to achieve the goals through quick start guides, implementation, and informative references. Recognizing that different organizations use various technologies, CSF 2.0 is not limited to specific types, industries, or sizes. It looks ahead, ready to adapt to changes in technologies like IT, IoT, and OT.
